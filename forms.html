    <!-- The HTML <form> element defines a form that is used to collect user input:
     An HTML form contains form elements.
    Form elements are different types of input elements, like: text fields, checkboxes, 
    radio buttons, submit buttons, and more.  The <input> element is the most important form element. 
    The <input> element is displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.
    <input type="text">	Defines a single-line text input field
    <input type="radio">	Defines a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
    <input type="submit">	Defines a submit button (for submitting the form)
    <input type="text"> defines a single-line input field for text input.
    Note: The form itself is not visible. Also note that the default width of an input field is 20 characters.-->

      <!-- The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements.
      The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, 
      because the screen-reader will read out load the label when the user is focused on the input element. 
      The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions 
      (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, 
      it toggles the radio button/checkbox. The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the 
      id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.
      Each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.
      If the name attribute is omitted, the data of that input field will not be sent at all.
      The input value attribute specifies an initial value for an input field. These are like initial default values.-->
