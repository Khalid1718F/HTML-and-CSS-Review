<!-- Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.
HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
Note: A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element. 
Without a forward slash at the end of subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server. 
Many servers will automatically add a forward slash to the end of the address, and then create a new request.-->

    <!-- This is how links are set up internally within our project:
    First we create a new html page called about.html and use a <a> tag to define it
    its href attribute will link back to this page which is the homepage. 
    This page will use it's own <a> tag to refer to the about.html page.-->
    <h1>This is an internal link:</h1>
    <a href="/bookmarks.html"> Click this to navigate here.</a>

    <!-- Hyperlinks are defined with the HTML <a> tag:
    The href attribute specifies the destination address
    Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address.-->
