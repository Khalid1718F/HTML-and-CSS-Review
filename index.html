<!--HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements are represented by tags
HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.
An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and an end tag, with the content inserted in between:
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. 
Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"-->

<!--This Tells the browser what version of HTML is being used. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--This is the root element of the HTML page which has the language 
attribute to show that our document is in english.-->
<html lang="en">
  <!--This is the HTML head element. This element acts as a container 
  for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page, 
  that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. 
  It is also known as a child element element. This is because it is nested in
  the html root element above and is therefore a child of it.
  It includes things like keywords 
  and a page description that you want to appear in search results, 
  CSS to style our content, 
  character set declarations, and more. -->
  <head>
    <!-- This is an HTML metatag is a tag that defines information about our file.
    This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8,
    which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. 
    Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it.-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!--This is a meta description tag. It gives a description for our website.
    Inside the tags we have attributes such as name and content.-->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!--This is the title element.This sets the title of your page, 
    which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in, 
    and is used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.-->
    <title>This is my webpage.</title>
  <!--This is the end tag of our head element.-->
  </head>
  <!--This is the body element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users
  when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, 
  or whatever else. The body is also a child element of the root element which is the html element.
  This is due to the fact that it is nested inside the html element.-->
  <body>
    <!--Inside the body we have our headng element with the content.
    <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
    The heading element is the grandchild of the root element which is html. 
    The reason is because it is nested inside the child of the root which makes it the grandchild.-->
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is heading 6</h6>

    The paragraph is also a grandchild of the root element which is html.-->
    <p>I am creating a webpage with HTML!</p>
    <!--If we would like to use dummy text to hold the place of where we would like to 
    place content for our paragraph while were still deciding, we can use the keyword 'lorem'
    from emmet and we can even put the number of words we would like to have included in our dummy 
    text next the word lorem. The word would be placed betwee our two paragraph elements.-->
